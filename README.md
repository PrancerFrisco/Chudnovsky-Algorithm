# Chudnovsky-Algorithm
This programme is made for Python.
It uses an algorithm known as the 'Chudnovsky algorithm' (see on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm).

Needs mpmath module - use 'pip install mpmath' to install the module.
Uses the math and time modules as well.

This is in no way an efficient way of calculating pi compared to other languages, I also made it.
