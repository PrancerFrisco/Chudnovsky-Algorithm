# Chudnovsky-Algorithm
This programme is made for Python.
It uses an algorithm known as the 'Chudnovsky algorithm' (see on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm).

Needs mpmath module - use 'pip install mpmath' to install the module.
Uses the math and time modules as well.

This is the fastest code available (to my knowledge) in ***Python*** for the hCudnovsky algorithm.
