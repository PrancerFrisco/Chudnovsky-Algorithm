# Chudnovsky-Algorithm
This programme is made for Python.
It uses an algorithm known as the 'Chudnovsky algorithm' (see on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm).

Needs mpmath module - use 'pip install mpmath' to install the module.
Uses the math and time modules as well.

It took around 14.5 seconds for it to calculate pi to 100,000 digits on my laptop.
